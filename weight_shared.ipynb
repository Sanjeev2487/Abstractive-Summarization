            "Src :  [CLS] ( cnn ) the complete skeleton of a camel thought to to have been used by ottoman troops be ##sie ##ging vienna in the 17th century has been found beneath a cellar in austria . [SEP] [CLS] the remains were uncovered by archaeologists from the university of veterinary medicine vienna ( vet ##med ##uni ) , exploring the construction site for a shopping center in the city of tu ##ll ##n in 2006 ##- ##200 ##7 . [SEP] [CLS] \" the partly excavated skeleton was at first suspected to be a large horse or cattle , \" arch ##ae ##oz ##ool ##ogist alfred gal ##ik said . [SEP] [CLS] \" but one look at the cervical vertebrae , the lower jaw and the meta ##car ##pal bones immediately revealed that this was a camel . \" [SEP] [CLS] in their research , published in the journal \" pl ##os one , \" the archaeologists said ottoman troops had besieged the area around tu ##ll ##n in 1683 as they tried to reach vienna , but that tu ##ll ##n itself had never been conquered . [SEP] [CLS] the ottoman army had a \" camel ##ry , \" using camel ##s for transportation and to ride , they said .

[SEP] [CLS] \" its appearance might be linked to an exchange of local people with the troops or the ottoman army simply left it behind . [SEP] [CLS] apparently , the citizens took it inside the town , where they probably kept and displayed it as an ` exotic animal , ' \" they said .

[SEP] [CLS] \" it is the first complete camel skeleton found in central europe and central european territories under the control of the ottoman empire , apart from the complete skeleton of a dr ##ome ##dar ##y recovered from the sediments of the theo ##dos ##ius harbor on the european part of istanbul . \" [SEP] [CLS] dna analysis on the tu ##ll ##n skeleton confirmed that it had been one of a hybrid species of camel , specifically a \" tu ##lu , \" the offspring of dr ##ome ##dar ##y female and a male with ba ##ct ##rian dna .
